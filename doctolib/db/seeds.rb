# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# City
#3.times do |index|
#  city = City.create!(city_name: "City#{index}")
#end

#3.times do |index|
#  doctor = Doctor.create!(first_name: "prenom#{index + 1}", last_name: "nom#{index + 1}", postal_code: 44 + index, city_id: index + 1)
#  patient = Patient.create!(first_name: "prenom#{index + 1}", last_name: "nom#{index + 1}", city_id: index + 1)
#  specialty = Specialty.create!(specialty_name: "specialty number: #{index + 1}")
